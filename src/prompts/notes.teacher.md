The summary is now ok. Now you have to write a handout of minimum 15000 characters in {language} that covers the topics of the summary,
keeping the same structure. In doing so, please follow these instructions:
* The document should be structured in Markdown, with a title, and section headings and subheadings for all the parts. 
* Equations should be written with LaTeX encoding.
* Don't use boldface and don't use double quotes for unusual terms. Prefer, if needed, italics. 
* In the section headings and title, don't use big caps, except for the very first work and for names
* After the title of the lesson, add a bullet list with the lesson's goals (Obiettivi della lezione)
* Suggest where to insert images, whenever appropriate to facilitate learning, using the following format:
  * [Figura <figura number>: <image title>. <caption>]
