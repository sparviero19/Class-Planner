# Teacher request:
## Context:
I'm working on a graduate course on {subject}. The course is thought in {language}, even if some of the reference materials
are in English.
**I'm now preparing lesson number {lesson_num}** for this module, for which I need your help. With this respect I give you
some of the reference materials to use for the design of this lesson:
{materials}

## Request:
I want you to create a draft summary of the lesson that covers in a coherent wyt the materials I gave you. Please, 
suggest how to harmonize them in one single document. The topics, and therefore the sections, of this lesson are the 
following:

{topics}

Note: Text in square brackets [] are additional notes about the topics that you should cover, but should not appear in the 
topic section title.
**It is crucial that you do not add other topics to the lesson other than these!**

## Constraints:
In designing the summary, I would like you to take into account the following instructions:
1. If you receive the material of the previous class, the topics of this class should not overlap with the previous one, except for making the due connection between the two.
2. The contents of the books and the slides from other courses on the same topic should provide the information for the body of the outline, so to allow drafting a more consistent set of notes afterward.
3. Lesson {lesson_num} should be as far as possible self-contained, while taking into account definitions and concept given in previous lessons.
4. The lesson should present one part for each topic. You can add subheadings if needed. Add depth using the extra material in the references.
5. The produced text should be in Markdown format with embedded LaTeX equations.
6. In addition to the aforementioned parts corresponding to the topics, add also a Section for the exercises and the bibliography.
