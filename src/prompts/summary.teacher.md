# Teacher request:
## Context:
I'm working on a graduate course on {subject}. The course is thought in {language}, even if some of the reference materials
are in English. I'm now preparing lesson number {lesson_num}, for which I need your help. With this respect I give you
some of the reference materials to use for the design of this lesson:
{materials}
Note: The slides that contain my draft of the live lesson should be the one defining the topics that have to be covered.

## Request:
I want you to create a draft summary of the lesson that covers in a coherent wyt the materials I gave you. Please, 
suggest how to harmonize them in one single document. In particular, I would like you to take into account the following
instructions:
1. The topics of this class should not overlap with the previous one, except for making the due connection between the two.
2. The contents of the books and the slides from other courses on the same topic should provide the information for the body of the outline, so to allow drafting a more consistent set of notes afterward. 
3. Lesson {lesson_num} should be as far as possible self-contained, while taking into account definitions and concept given in previous lessons.
4. The lesson should present from 3 to 5 parts, depending on the extension of the topics.  
   1. start by defining the main topics from the reference slides
   2. add depth using the extra material in the other references
5. The produced text should be in Markdown format with embedded LaTeX equations.
6. In addition to the aforementioned parts, add also a Section for the exercises and the bibliography.
